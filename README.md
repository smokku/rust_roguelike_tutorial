# Rust Roguelike Tutorial

This is a [Roguelike Tutorial - in Rust](https://github.com/thebracket/rustrogueliketutorial) implemented using Legion ECS (instead of SPECS).

Still work in progress - as I progress through the tutorial.

## Running

Unfortunately, it requires `master` branch of Legion, so you will need to checkout [legion](https://github.com/TomGillen/legion) beside this repo.
